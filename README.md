# Anonymous-Lightweight---IIOT
In the IIoT environment, the gathered real-time data is transmitted over the public channel, which raises the issues of security and privacy in this environment.
Therefore, to protect illegal access by an adversary, user authentication mechanism is one of the promising security solutions in the IIoT environment. To achieve this goal, we implement a user authenticated key agreement scheme in which only authorized users can access the services from the designated IoT sensing devices installed in the IIoT environment.
The verification for the key agreement scheme is done in AVISPA tool.
